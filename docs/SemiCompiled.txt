Literals Variables and arrays
  Bit 4 (16): 1 = Embedded Value
  Bit 3  (8): 1 = Line Address  
  Bit 2  (4): 0 = Simple Variable, 1 = Array     
  Bit 1  (2): 0 = Literal, 1 = Variable
  Bit 0  (1): 0 = Float, 1 = String

Float Literal:   16, binary_float
String Literal:  17, string_descriptor
Float Variable:  18, variable_address
String Variable: 19, variable_address
Float Array:     22, array_dimensions_address?
String Array:    23, array_dimensions_address?
Line Address     24, address

Handling Embedded Values
  GOTO and GOSUB - Modify SCNLBL
  All others - Modify Hook 9 eval_ext
