    String constants are groups of alphanumeric information like letters,
  numbers and symbols. When you enter a string from the keyboard, it
  can have any length up to the space available in an 80-character line
  (that is, any character spaces NOT taken up by the line number and other
  required parts of the statement).
    A string constant can contain blanks, letters, numbers, punctuation
  and color or cursor control characters in any combination. You can even
  put commas between numbers. The only character which cannot be included
  in a string is the double quote mark ("). This is because the double
  quote mark is used to define the beginning and end of the string.
  A string can also have a null value-which means that it can contain no
  character data. You can leave the ending quote mark off of a string if
  it's the last item on a line or if it's followed by a colon (:). Some
  examples of string constants are:

               ""         ( a null string)
               "HELLO"
               "$25,000.00"
               "NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES"
