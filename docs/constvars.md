# Constants and Variables

## Integer, Floating-Point and String Constants

Constants are the data values that you put in your BASIC statements. 
BASIC uses these values to represent data during statement execution.
Aquarius BASIC can recognize and manipulate three types of constants:

- **[Integer Numbers](Integer-Constants)**
- **[Floating-Point Numbers](Floating-Point-Constants)**
- **[Strings](String-Constants)**
